This is my setup for YoRadio / "e" Radio.

I couldn't find any documentation on ny PCM5102 sound DAC so this was quite a mission.

I am using ESP32 WROOM Dev Module and SSD1306 Oled Screen with Rotary Encoder and PCM5102 DAC

This is to help alk the NEWBIES how to connect all together.

I am using this hardware in an enclosure with one speaker thus the mono command in Myoptions file. 
So take note that if you use it in stereo, you must delete mono force command line.
